# uniswapV3core-analysis

In an effort to better understand one of the most used and gas efficient DApps on Ethereum, I've gone through each line of the Uniswap core contracts and added comments where necessary. My comments are in line, start with a capital letter, and end with punctuation to distinguish them from Uniswap's own comments. These reviews have shown me safe ways to perform arithmetic and transfers, how to save gas, standard syntax, and overall gave me a better understand of how V3 works among other things.
