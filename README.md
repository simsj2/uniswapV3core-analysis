# uniswapV3core-analysis

In an effort to better understand one of the most used and gas efficient DApps on Ethereum, I've gone through each line of the Uniswap core contracts and added comments where necessary to show my understanding of the code. These comments are in line, start with a capital letter, and end with punctuation to distinguish them from Uniswap's own comments. These contract reviews have shown me the standard syntax for Solidity smart contracts, safe ways to perform arithmetic and transfers, how to save gas, implement libraries, and overall gave me a better understand of how V3 works.
